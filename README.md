# Gym Essentials Frontend

This is a frontend project for an e-commerce website specializing in gym products. It showcases an interactive and user-friendly interface built with Vue.js, and styled using modern CSS and HTML practices.

## Overview

The project represents the public-facing portion of an online store where users can browse through a catalog of gym products. It features product listings, detailed views, and a shopping cart. Note that this is a frontend-only project, and the backend functionality (like database interactions and server-side logic) is not included as it was beyond the scope of the subject matter.
